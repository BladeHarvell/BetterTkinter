I am currently amidst developing a library module to use alongside tkinter which will;

A) Improve the looks of tkinter UI's.
B) Provide more options for UI elements.
C) Provide Documentation on this Library on how to best use it.

Some examples of what is to be included;
 
A function for drawing elements with rounded corners
Transparent elements
Better Buttons - Including Hover animations, Hover Animations
Animations for element transitions
Borders on elements
Charts (Currently Bar, Line and Pie, lmk abt other ideas)
More fonts

 
Even a drag and drop design interface with code generation and output ðŸ™‚ (long term goal though...)

 
And I am still accepting ideas so be sure to put them below!

This library is still in development however I am looking at publishing version 0.0.1 before the new years.
let me know your thoughts on this, I chose tkinter as it is relatively easy too learn for beginners and it has a lot of potential but will take a lot of time to be near complete.

Complete Features:
 
Rounded Corners
On Rectangles and Circles Only
Border Edges
On Rectangles and Circles Only
Transparent Fill
On Rectangles and Circles Only

Known Bugs:
None because im a perfectionist ðŸ˜«
