#BetterTkinter (BTk) Design Studio

I am currently amidst developing a library module to use alongside tkinter which will;

* Improve the looks of tkinter UI's.
* Provide more options for UI elements.
* Provide Documentation on this Library on how to best use it.

Some examples of what is to be included;
 
 - A function for drawing elements with rounded corners
 - Transparent elements
 - Better Buttons - Including Hover animations, Hover Animations
 - Animations for element transitions
 - Borders on elements
 - Charts (Currently Bar, Line and Pie, lmk abt other ideas)
 - More fonts!

** And I am still accepting ideas so be sure to put them below!**

*This library is still in development however I am looking at publishing version 0.0.1 before the new years. let me know your thoughts on this, I chose tkinter as it is relatively easy too learn for beginners and it has a lot of potential but will take a lot of time to be near complete.*

__Complete Features:__
 
 - Rounded Corners
		- On Rectangles and Circles Only
 - Border Edges
	 - On Rectangles and Circles Only
 - Transparent Fill
	 - On Rectangles and Circles Only

__Known Bugs:__
 - None because im a perfectionist ðŸ˜«



The library will be Pip Installable with documentation here as well as having a design studio with drag and drop abilities.
